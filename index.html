						<p>I'm currently in my last year at UC Berkeley pursuing my passion in Psychology, Media Studies, and Business. As part of my interdisciplinary education, I have created my own research program centered on Technology, Culture, and Social Change. I love to work on projects that empower and connect people and communities, and hope to bring my strategic mindset and enthusiasm in any future opportunity, particularly in tech or consulting.</p>
						<p>Feel free to connect should you have any advice, opportunity, or just an interest in chatting! I would love to get to know you.</p>
